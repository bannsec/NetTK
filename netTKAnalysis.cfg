; NetTK Analysis Config File
;

; General layout is of the form
; [Engine] -- This defines what analysis engine you want to use (these are what is under analysis/*)
; alias_x -- (standard) the alias name to use (take this from the NetTK.cfg file)
; module_x -- (standard) The type of test that was used on this host. For example, "ping".
; ctag_x -- (optional) Optional tag to be used for defining save table name. Table name becomes "alias_module[_tag]". Useful when module is "tcpping" to keep track of  port/options/etc.
; attributes -- (This can vary by engine)

; This module is special and defines/starts what backend we're using.
