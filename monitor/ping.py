	Input:
		Associative array containing the following args. (i.e.: {"host": "Google.com", "alias": "Google"})
		host = host to monitor (i.e.: "google.com" or "192.168.1.1")
		alias = alias to give this host. This will be used in creating the table name (i.e.: "Google")
		tag = tag for saving information. provided by the framework
		(optional) delay = time delay in seconds between attempts to contact the host (i.e.: "1" without quotes for 1 second delays)
		(optional) timeout = how long to wait for a reply to the ping in seconds. defaults to 1 second.
		(optional) addRecord = Queue for adding records
		(optional) shouldExit = Event to signal when to exit

	Action:
		Ping's the host continuously until told to stop. Records packet delay time and dropped packets.
